# Public notes sharing

The goal of this repository is to act as a tool to share the content of the notes that I (the author) have taken from the different classes I have attended during my years at Universit√© Paul Sabatier : Master Informatique, Parcours IAFA.

These notes were mostly taken with Markdown with some mermaid graph.
